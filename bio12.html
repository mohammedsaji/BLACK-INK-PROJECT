            <div class="prod_desc"><p>Vladimir Putin, born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Russia, is a Russian politician who has served as the President of Russia since 2012. He previously served as President from 1999 to 2008 and as Prime Minister from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. Prior to his political career, Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for many years.

                Putin's rise to power began in the late 1990s when he was appointed Prime Minister by President Boris Yeltsin. He quickly gained popularity for his strong leadership style and his efforts to stabilize Russia's economy and restore its influence on the world stage. In 2000, Putin was elected President, and he has remained a dominant figure in Russian politics ever since.</p></div>
