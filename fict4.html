            <div class="prod_desc"><p>In the remote coastal town of Seabrook, rumors swirl of a mysterious being lurking beneath the waves, half-human and half-creature from the sea. Legend has it that this enigmatic figure, known as the "Tide Walker," possesses the ability to bridge the divide between land and sea, wielding powers beyond imagination.

                When young fisherman Ethan stumbles upon a wounded stranger washed ashore during a fierce storm, he discovers the truth behind the myths. The stranger, a girl named Marina, bears strange markings and exhibits uncanny abilities that hint at her connection to the sea.
                
                As Ethan nurses Marina back to health, they form an unlikely bond forged by fate. Marina reveals that she is indeed the fabled Tide Walker, born of a forbidden union between a human and a sea-dwelling creature. Hunted by those who seek to exploit her powers, Marina must unravel the secrets of her past and embrace her destiny to protect both worlds from impending danger.</p></div>
